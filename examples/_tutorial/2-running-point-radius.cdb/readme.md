In this example, we desire to visualize on point which position is determined by `ax` and `ay` parameters.
In addition, we desire to control visual point radius by `r` parameter.

To solve this case, we generate separate csv files with point coordinates and radius,
one file for each (`ax`,`ay`,`r`) combination.

Then we refer to that files from `data.csv` file, among with parameter values.
